<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I'm Hannah and I live in Raleigh, NC. I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016. I
    earned a Bachelor of Arts in public relations from the School of Media and Journalism. In the years following
    graduation, I have worked in digital marketing, communications, and technology. Currently, I am earning a
    certification in web development from UNC-Chapel Hill and will be starting at IBM in early November.</p>
  <p>When I'm not in class or at work, I'm with friends at a local brewery or reading a good book. Being relatively new
    to Raleigh, I still have a lot of places to see and explore. I live with my cat Luna near PNC Arena. Neither of us
    are big fans of hockey or the traffic that comes with it. When we're home, Luna prefers lying in the sunlight while I prefer
    watching Netflix.</p>
  <p>Some more fun facts about me: I've never left the East Coast except for a business trip to Bucharest, Romania,
    earlier this year; I'm a three-time champion of Parks & Recreation trivia; I can wiggle my ears; and I have an
    addiction to Madewell. </p>
